Hi,

Question from a newbie but I don't know how to solve it.
I created a blog based on Ananke theme (https://www.vincentguilleux.fr/). I want to change the text in the upper left part so that it is different from the big header.
In the inspector it seems to be respectively part of
.  <div class="flex-l justify-between items-center center"><a href="https://blissful-sammet-2395f4.netlify.com" class="f3 fw2 hover-white no-underline white-90 dib">Vincent Guilleux - Mes premiers pas dans le dev</a><div class="flex-l items-center"></div></div>
. <h1 class="f2 f-subheadline-l fw2 white-90 mb0 lh-title">Vincent Guilleux - Mes premiers pas dans le dev</h1>

I tried to change directly in public/index.html but is has no effect. Any idea?

Index.XML to update the summary of 1st psost
